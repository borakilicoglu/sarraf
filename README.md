## ⚡ What is Sadrazam?

Sadrazam is a CLI tool that scans your project and tells you:

- which dependencies are **unused**
- which ones are **misplaced or risky**
- what you can safely **remove or fix**

👉 And if you enable AI:  
it explains **why**, **what to do next**, and supports **agent-friendly TOON output** for automation and LLM workflows.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npx sadrazam .
```

That’s it.

---

## 🧠 Example Output

```
❌ Unused dependency: lodash
💡 Suggested: remove

⚠️ Misplaced dependency: typescript
💡 Suggested: move to devDependencies
```

With AI:

```
🧠 lodash is not imported anywhere in your codebase.
Removing it will reduce bundle size and install time.
```

---

## 🎯 Why Sadrazam?

JavaScript projects accumulate dependencies over time.

- unused packages slow installs
- wrong dependencies increase risk
- messy `package.json` hurts maintainability

Sadrazam answers one question:

👉 **What can I safely remove from this project?**

---

## 🔥 What Makes It Different?

Unlike traditional tools:

- detects unused dependencies AND unused files/exports
- understands monorepos and modern frameworks
- optional AI layer for real explanations (not raw output)
- safe auto-fix for `package.json`

---

## ⚡ Common Use Cases

- clean up old projects
- audit dependency bloat
- prepare for production
- CI dependency checks
- monorepo hygiene

---

## 🛠️ Usage

Basic scan:

```bash
npx sadrazam .
```

JSON output:

```bash
npx sadrazam . --reporter json
```

TOON output:

```bash
npx sadrazam . --reporter toon
```

Auto-fix:

```bash
npx sadrazam . --fix --format
```

Trace why something is used:

```bash
npx sadrazam . --trace typescript
```

---

## 🧠 AI Mode (Optional)

Enable AI to get explanations and recommendations:

```bash
AI_PROVIDER=openai AI_TOKEN=your_token npx sadrazam . --ai
```

AI will:

- explain why a dependency is unused
- suggest what action to take
- summarize cleanup steps

---

## ⚙️ Features

- unused dependency detection
- unused file + export detection
- monorepo & workspace support
- script-aware scanning
- CommonJS + modern import support
- safe auto-fix
- JSON + TOON + text output
- AI-powered insights

## 📦 Install

```bash
npm install -g sadrazam
```

or:

```bash
npx sadrazam .
```

---

## 🧪 When to Use It

Run Sadrazam when:

- your project feels bloated
- you're unsure which deps are safe to remove
- you're preparing for deployment
- you're reviewing a codebase

---

## 💡 Philosophy

Sadrazam is built around a simple idea:

> **Keep your dependency tree clean, understandable, and safe.**

AI is optional — the core tool works without it.
